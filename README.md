A Team Communication App

WyzePal eases team communication by keeping conversations organized, structured and on-topic. No more messy email threads. No more chaotic real-time chatting. WyzePal keeps all your team communication and collaboration organized and on-topic in asynchronous threads so everyone can work more productively.

Teamwork doesn’t need to be chaotic and stressful. WyzePal coordinates all your team’s conversations so that they are always structured, contextual, and in one place.

WyzePal is the best communication App for teams of all sorts, distributed or within the same building. Stop being busy all day going to meetings after meetings only to simply get an update on what your team are working on or achieved, be part of that achievement.

WyzePal makes team collaboration more structured and productive so your teammates can focus their attention on the work that really matters. Your team can choose when exactly to connect to discuss things and when to disconnect to get work done. Stop wasting your time getting updates from your team, be part of them in real-time while you focus on what matters, business.

With WyzePal, people can mindfully disconnect, which allows for deeper work and more meaningful interactions when teammates check in again. 

And unlike email, everything in WyzePal stays accessible and searchable for everyone, forever, so no team work is ever lost or buried, even if someone leaves your business.

Keep all your conversations and team chats organized by projects in asynchronous Threads. Receive announcements on important updates, discuss ideas in Threads, coordinate project updates, and gather feedback right on any of your devices, Linux machine, Mac, iPhone, Android and Windows.
